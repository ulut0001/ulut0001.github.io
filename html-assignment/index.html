                I am an International student of <strong>Interactive Media Design</strong> , Spring2021 intake in Algonquin College. I have a 4-year Bachelor's Degree in Industrial Design, and also I had 4-year Civil Engineering education but not had a degree, I withdrawed at the end of 4<sup>th</sup> year to not go to mandatory military duty. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Before I applied to <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> program, for 10+ years I worked in physical product design, manufacturing, design management, interior design, construction management, I am also experienced in handcrafts like leatherworking, carpentry, metalworking, seramics. So here I want to fill missing skills in digital design to have complete skillset that a <em>designer</em> could have.
